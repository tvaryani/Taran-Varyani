### 2. Meal-Prep Service Website
A website for customers to sign up for my summer meal prep subscription. I started to offer my cooking services
to friends last summer and I would cook them dinner X times a week based on how many meals they wanted. I
offered two separate packages (2 meals/week for $36 and 4 meals/week for $60). I hope to continue this meal
prep service this coming summer on a larger scale, so I decided to dedicate this project to building a website for
the service. I will let customers choose their food preferences and frequency of meals.
